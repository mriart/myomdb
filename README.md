My OMDB, a quick response when queryng a movie.

It has a CLI and a web server for web and mobile apps. There is the package movie that supports all functions. 
It is a GO divertimento basically.

Credits to OMDB, for which you require an API key. 
This key should be placed in API_KEY env variable.
